Xenia is an experimental emulator for the Xbox 360. For more information, see the
[Xenia wiki](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary/wiki).

Come chat with us about **emulator-related topics** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q9mxZf9).
For developer chat join `#dev` but stay on topic. Lurking is not only fine, but encouraged!
Please check the [FAQ](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/wiki/FAQ) page before asking questions.
We've got jobs/lives/etc, so don't expect instant answers.

Discussing illegal activities will get you banned.

## Contributors Wanted!

Have some spare time, know advanced C++, and want to write an emulator?
Contribute! There's a ton of work that needs to be done, a lot of which
is wide open greenfield fun.

**For general rules and guidelines please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

Fixes and optimizations are always welcome (please!), but in addition to
that there are some major work areas still untouched:

* Help work through [missing functionality/bugs in games](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/compat)
* Reduce the size of Xenia's [huge log files](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/issues/1526)
* Skilled with Linux? A strong contributor is needed to [help with porting](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/platform-linux)

See more projects [good for contributors](https://github.com/xenia-project/xenia/labels/good%20first%20issue). It's a good idea to ask on Discord and check the issues page before beginning work on
something.

## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling
illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...).
